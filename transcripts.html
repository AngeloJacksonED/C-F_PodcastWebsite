            Welcome back Frog, how are you doing.
            
            Good Camel.
            
            Great to hear buddy.
            
            Here’s today’s question for you all. Milk or chocolate milk, let us know on our website, www.camelfrogpodcast.com, if you can!
            
            We shall get started immediately.
            
            Dialing up a special person today, he is a creator of this podcast and has created only 4 episodes for us. Please welcome Mr B.F.F!
            
            Hello guys!
            
            Hi there buddy, how it going dude?
            
            So great to be back.
            
            Not only you’re here, it’s a great honour to see you come to this podcast and give your opinions.
            
            Yes indeed.
            
            He did 4 episodes on his own podcast before it was given to our man, Angelo Jackson.
            
            Hello.
            
            There he is.
            
            Alright, back to our old director and creator, let’s talk.
            
            Hey, Remember that time when A Girl 4 was here on our island back then?
            
            Maybe, I don’t remember seeing her on your Tomodachi life game.
            
            Well, she got ugly and just, it was a disaster.
            
            Oof mate, sorry to hear that.
            
            No need to be sorry.
            
            I think you were on our island before, no joke but I remember that part at least.
            
            So, how’s life going?
            
            Pretty good. I have been doing a bunch of videos, we had a speedrun filled with lots of level runs, we went out for groceries and was doing some research.
            
            Epic. Speedruns are pretty cool in my opinion.
            
            Interesting to hear. I have done Game Party speedruns.
            
            Cool.
            
            What have you done so far on your YouTube channel.
            
            I am still doing Wii Sports Resort and Wii Sports, I did some Super Mario Maker 2 as well.
            
            I have an assortment of random stuff on my Projects channel too, as well as some cool golf shots to show off. I have been doing Wheel of Fortune too, I keep getting Food and Drink though as my category a few times.
            
            Oof, same as me!
            Lol
            
            Epic buddy. You also linked our website which was nice of you.
            
            Yeah, you got that right, although that favicon doesn’t work!
            
            Oof, hope they fix it soon.
            
            Indeed.
            
            I once remember there was a commercial about aging and tips if you were worried if looks took off so fast.
            
            What does that mean?
            
            So we have this scented cream to wipe it off, making healthy stew to be just healthy and be stride!
            
            Epic, are those sold anywhere?
            
            Sadly No. 
            
            I zoom out. Just kidding.
            
            If your whole world was going to go dark tomorrow, what would you look at today?
            
            Hey, those were one of the questions from the Tomodachi Life game!
            Food maybe.
            
            You must love ice cream.
            
            It’s spring tho.
            
            Anyways, you have your story called the GoodJobBoy760000 Foundation.
            
            One of the first 4 stories that our guest callers will share. Without any further or do, let’s hear it!

            Yeah. That’s it?
            
            Yeah. A Boy. He was on our island and had a lot of problems so we’ve helped him a lot, also gave him some clothes too.
            
            Epic, how is he doing so far?

           <h6><p style="color:white;">Hello and welcome to episode 6 of our podcast! Frog is off today.

            The question of the day, who is your favourite companion? Let us know on our website!
            
            Let’s get caller 6 on the line!
            
            Hello there.
            
            Hello. How is it going Robot 2!
            
            Nice. Thanks.
            
            Alright, we are now prepared! Let’s talk. Do you have a story?
            
            Yes I do. 
            
            Well, let’s start chatting, there is a lot to say!
            
            I remember, back then for years, we had a partnership, he was a manufacture. I manage to acquire to make you basically, successful.
            
            What is it?
            
            Right now, today. We are in production and distribution as well as manufacturing.
            
            Nice.
            
            I plan to have a new house with my job. 
            
            Oof. After all of that, you want a house?
            
            Yes. Project must avoid strike, where each of my partners will pay me. $100 dollars.
            
            What?
            
            Projects begin in 3 days. 
            
            I see.
            
            Anyone out? Maybe not?
            
            People say love is more important than money. Sounds logical.
            
            I want to talk something that has been brought up on this episode.
            
            Let’s hear it.
            
            It’s the mystery of the green butterfly.
            
            I do not remember seeing a green butterfly, but a person who spoke to the podcast said there was a green butterfly before in the Vancouver convention center.
            
            Is it real?
            
            The person thinks it is real.
            The one that is featured is in the color Orange.
            I see.
            It went missing and one theory is that it was given away, possibly to Joanne’s children.
            There is yet to provide more information sooner.
            I never know how to react when people say I look like someone else.

            Hey here's a question for you all. Milk or Chocolate Milk? Let us know on our website if you can. 
            The link is www.camelfrogpodcast.com. We like to see you there. Indeed now we shall get started immediately. 
            Today we are looking at the internet because why not? Yeah, Frog is ready to hear about it. Great but first let's get caller number 5 on the board with this dial him up. 
            Hello guys. Hello welcome to our podcast! How are you doing today? I am doing good Sir. Right let's talk now. All right since there are many videos containing my voice I thought we'd listen to them. This one is really funny that contains the bits meme, Lmao. Let's listen. (* VIDEO PLAYS) LMAO!. The 128 bits is where you're at. Yeah proud to be in it another video please. It's a matter of time until he stops airfrying them too. (Peploe) think girls like sweets, boys like salty, but I like sold more than sweets. 
            OOOOHHHH K. Oof. Not all girls like sweets and boys like salty. I was confused at the end. Lmao. Remember the 5 Gum Memes. Yeah they are funny indeed, here's the example. How it feels to chew 5 gum. (*sound plays) Stimulate your senses. I hope the sound the person made is not serious, I hope he's OK. Same here. Here's a draft of the video made by today's caller. Wow awesome caller. What is da matter? Imma sad. Whatcha mean? I've been waiting to beat someone in boxing. What do you mean? I bet my money.(----) Those aren't real people mate... Imma Sad. Imma Sad. 
            He sent this to the podcast right? Yes I did. OK. All right I think we can end the call for you here. We will explore more internet stuff next time. Thank you for coming. Thank you very much, bye. See you buddy. Bye. All righty, now our final words before we sign off, we are sorry it took this long to make another episode we have a real life work that is stopping us. We hope you understand. Yeah, okay now let's do it y'all. (think music plays) OK, bye everyone see you again soon. Take care all. (whispers). End music.</h6>

         <h6><p style="color:white;">Hello everyone and welcome to our first podcast. Camel here. Frog is off. We got our first guest and he's here right now! How you doing? Hi! I am good how are you doing? Good thanks. Where are you from? Colorado. Nice! That's good to hear do you live by Park Meadows Mall in Lone Tree Colorado? Don't mind me asking, I'm into radios like you are and I am really interested in the mall security at Park Meadows. Yeah, I am close to it though. Yeah because I saw you commented on the Park Meadows mall elevator video on YouTube that's why I asked. Which video?
          He replied to a comment saying 1993 on the YouTube channel Elevator Central 1. Yeah because I thought Montgomery Cons were invaded in 1993. I see, thanks for popping in. No problem. All right that was caller one on the list. Anyways you can catch me anytime here maybe this might be deleted but who knows. I have a long story to tell and that will be very soon. But for now, I just want to square off with audio video of ours. Here it is. Robot is on the rise. I seen you in Star Wars too, you look just like one indeed. Yeah should my true colors in the film so I am made of lego, right? Yeah, I see so you don't remember anything even the film itself. 
          No I just watched the movie I didn't hit anyone. Then how do you appear in the movie then? I just watched it that's all.. Your very confused Sir. That makes sense well anyways we will talk later when we have doughnuts at the end of this taping to sell. That was confusing, indeed. Tomorrow we will touch in with him. For now, I am off this set for filming. Bye bye.</h6>
