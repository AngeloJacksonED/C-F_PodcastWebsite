              <h5><p style="color:white;">Hello and Happy Easter Monday. Please do listen to Episode 7 of our podcast. It was really fun and enjoyable. Now you will hear the story of me (AndrewED) and my partners who helped me 
              on the Podcast. The story could be new or confusing to you but we want to assure you understand and learn how much it means to us while making a podcast at a higher level. It's a story that I am able to hold on to for a long time! 
              For now I am on break and Angelo is monitoring the podcast, he really is enjoying the ride so far and is looking for more. Take care everybody! - AndrewED - EDProd.</p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">So to start, we mentioned Andrew on a <a href="/news/what-makes-this-low-budget-podcast">previous article</a>. Helping along with AngeloJacksonED to get the equipment but it didn't work out.
              Although Andrew's help was needed.... the story about him is to be revealed.</p>

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>So who's AndrewED?</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">AndrewED also known as the standard: Andrew Melvor is known for working on EDProductions, a simple private production company where small business who works on projects and production, 
              mainly on podcasts and websites. 2 podcasts (1 is this one!), one more was added on gaming which is being planned by 5 other staff members, and 5 tools are used.
              Andrew loved Television as a kid and then eventually grew up to work and last thing mention on our lists, he held Spotify for listening music to his pocket. Then after that looked at the podcasts and wanted to make one. When Mr B.F.F left
              the Camel and Frog Live Podcast and Angelo J. acquired the podcast, Angelo immediately called Andrew for his help. Andrew said <i>"Great job Angelo! Glad we had our first deal! Can't wait to work on this....."</i>.</p>

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Part 1 - What's AndrewED's Prompt?</i></p>
              <h5><p style="color:white;">As a matter of fact, While Andrew is taking a break from the Podcast to work on other projects, he did serve light equipment, (NOT A PC), the podcast needed and helped Angelo produce and create for him!
              Getting along after Mr B.F.F left with us, planning immediately began when Andrew saw the opportunity.</p>
              <h5><p style="color:white;">He said: <i>Alright! Let's first change the details so it matches our brand.....</i></p>
              <h5><p style="color:white;">Angelo immediately said <i>That doesn't seem right....</i></p>
              <h5><p style="color:white;">Then we video called Mr B.F.F regarding the final changes he wanted to have. So the plan was to keep the Author's name of the Podcast for now. Although
              Andrew wanted to do that.... Angelo didn't care about name changes and wanted to show support for Mr B.F.F who did the majority of the setup of the Podcast, so Andrew took part to keep the podcast details under control and the way it was.... it gets 
              shown on Streaming Services.</p>

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Part 2 - What Happened?</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">Continuing on the matter..... Andrew had plans to up the quality of the Podcast, but however Angelo got a text from Mr B.F.F receiving an Email from Audry. The email that got received was sent from an RSS feed of the podcast..... 
              Now that too much emails got sent to Mr B.F.F the matter already got resolved a while ago and that prompted to change the email of the RSS feed linked. After that Angelo didn't know if it was safe to use Audry to grow the podcast's community. Andrew went home after
              work to set one up.... it was a matter of time after the Podcast was distributed on Apple Podcasts... which took quite a while. So the wait just had to happen. Angelo had plans for new equipment to use but it didn't work out..... however in the previous story, you can find out how 
              the podcast's budget was set and how Angelo took matters in his own hands in the south down below.</p>

              <h4><p style="color:white;">READ STORY: <i><a href="/news/what-makes-this-low-budget-podcast">What Makes This A Low Budget Podcast?</a></i></h4>

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Part 3 - Did he want to change the Setup?</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">Now reiterating to what part 2 happened: The Quality of the Podcast. Andrew had plans to change the software. Andrew unfortunately couldn't get software to work because of a lot of payments to the tools needed. Although the tools need it high-quality, Andrew
              saying that it's used for productivity and is business typed. Although Andrew is disappointed about the decisions or if software capped to 10 mins, he needed to really set it up along with Angelo who needed to get his equipment out.....</p>
            
              <h5><p style="color:white;">Andrew said on his reaction: <i>We have to be really "Particular" and "Unique" about the setup of the podcast."</i> Angelo definitely agreed with that.</p>
              <h5><p style="color:white;">Now the plan was..... without messing up or shaking heads, Angelo said it's best if we did it the way Mr B.F.F did. Andrew had second thoughts of keeping the original creativity alive. Although when the podcast evolves, they would invite more real people to come and talk.
              While that feat is going to take a long time, it would still be best. Andrew said OK....</p>

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Part 4 - How it all happened.</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">Even though disagreements and agreements happened, they both set off on foot and went for the right changes. Kept how Mr B.F.F originally created episodes, with the Text to Speech service and record the stubs and finally edit them all. Although Andrew finds it stressing... Angelo
              doesn't. He finds it more productive and easy. As matter of fact as I am writing this with Andrew checking it, he marks them as a 5/5. But in all seriousness it's really stepping up to how creative it needs to be. Although a few rejections and agreements with the group, learning from constructive criticism is how 
              we learn. Andrew took the acceptance and will work even harder just like Angelo.

              <h5><p style="color:white;">Mr B.F.F had made a comment on this, saying: <i>I love how they learn from each other. Their plans are really adapting and making what I originally wrote, "grow".</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">After the Podcast got into Apple Podcasts, it was time to get into Audry. So we went in to sign up and finally established something that can help us grow even more. Angelo accepted that as per what Andrew made. And a community is about to grow more in the future.</p>

              <h4><p style="color:white;"><i>Conclusion</i></p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">The friendships Andrew and Angelo showed is just simply mind-blowing to us. Although there was some ups and downs, we communicate to our fullest and that's what really cares and matters. We are loving it.</p>

              <h5><p style="color:white;">After all of that, more episodes are being produced and we are proud of it. Andrew is now taking a break to work on other stuff on the ED Community and his work to catch up on in real life. We know that the podcast won't be alone. Angelo will keep it into good hands.</p>
